#### Abstract
In recent times, the Internet of Things (IoT) has seen
rapid advancements and subsequently the number of applications
has also increased significantly, resulting in new concepts such
as smart health, smart cities, and smart homes. These IoT
networks require vast amounts of processing and data storage.
Generally, cloud computing is used to meet these demands.
Although the cloud can provide processing and resources it still
faces some challenges. The rising number of IoT devices as well
as the distance between the cloud and these devices is an issue
since it leads to higher latency, which is an obstacle for realtime applications. Fog computing, which is a highly virtualized
paradigm can address these issues by delivering computational
resources, data storage and network services closer to the end
devices. However, there are issues such as heterogeneity that
plague fog computing and to tackle them centralized network
control in the form of Software Defined Networking (SDN) is
needed. In this paper, we describe SDN-enabled fog computing
and its architecture. Then, we present the unique features and
advantages of SDN-enabled fog over traditional fog computing.
Finally, we have discussed the challenges and solutions currently
faced in this paradigm.
